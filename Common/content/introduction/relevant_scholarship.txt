\section{Cause or Confound?}
There are numerous theories that address the motivations for adolescents' initiation of first intercourse (see \citealp{Rodgers1996} or \citealp{Buhi2007} for reviews), and even more specific precursors to first intercourse \citep{Buhi2007,DOnofrio2010,kirby2002antecedents,miller1997timing,santelli1992risk}. Many of these theories emphasize biology/genetics, where adolescent pubertal development (and associated hormone changes) drives the onset of sexual behavior \citep{miller1999dopamine,udry1979age,udry1994nature}. Other theoretical frameworks use social/environmental processes to explain developing sexual involvement in adolescence, such as Social Learning \citep{diblasio1990adolescent,hogben1998using}, where social norms affect the likelihood of early sexual behavior; or Social Control theory \citep{hirschi2002causes}, where societal and cultural influences reduce the likelihood that individuals will act on their natural tendency toward sexual involvement. Under these environmental theories the underlying biology is either ignored or actively resisted (\eg, Social Control theory), while under many of the biological/genetic theories, the environmental components are often ignored. 

However, numerous articles have also advocated integrative models \citep[See][]{harden2008rethinking,harden2014genetic,udry1995sociology}. The integrative Biopsychosocial Model acknowledges both genetic and environmental contributions to human behavior \citep{Engel1977,petersen1987nature,rodgers1999nature}. Indeed, biology, psychology, and society jointly influence adolescents' decisions to engage in sexual intercourse \citep{Meschke2000,zimmer2008ten}.
\subsection{Intelligence as Cause}
The short-term risks of early AFI are primarily negative, whereas the rewards for delay are primarily positive. These consequences are suggested to extend into adulthood -- early AFI has been related to adult delinquency \citep{harden2008rethinking}, anti-social behavior, and substance abuse \citep{boislard2011individual}, whereas those with delayed AFI have higher household incomes in adulthood \citep{Harden2012}. It is intuitively appealing to believe that intelligent individuals are more likely to observe this potential risk-reward trade off, and through volition act upon such observations by delaying first intercourse. Accordingly, intelligent individuals perceive the consequences of early AFI to negatively influence their careers \citep{halpern2000smart,harden2011don}.

Indeed, most of the literature has contributed to this belief, that intelligence is causally connected to AFI. Those with higher educational goals delay their first intercourse \citep{boislard2011individual,schvaneveldt2001academic}, whereas those who engaged in early sexual intercourse reduced their educational goals compared to earlier higher goals \citep{schvaneveldt2001academic}. Beyond academic goals, those with a greater affinity for risk and those who perceive benefits from teen-pregnancy are more likely to engage in risky sexual activities \citep{raffaelli2003sexual}. A greater understanding of the risks associated with sexual intercourse, such as HIV transmission, is also associated with delayed AFI \citep{mathews2009predictors}.

Smarter adolescents are more likely to report delayed intercourse \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}. Beyond intercourse, smarter individuals appear to postpone all sexual/romantic activity \citep{halpern2000smart}. Such blanket delays may be a proactive attempt to avoid first intercourse precursors. Thus, many researchers have concluded that ``[h]igher intelligence operates as a protective factor against early sexual activity during adolescence, and lower intelligence, to a point, is a risk factor.'' \citep[][p. 213]{halpern2000smart}.

However, \citet{halpern2000smart} and many of the other studies we have referenced above\citep[e.g.,][]{mathews2009predictors,miller1997timing,Paul2000} have used between family, typically cross-sectional, designs. Such designs cannot logically distinguish between processes that act to create differences between families and processes that create differences among family members \citep{Lahey2010,Rodgers2000}. Thus the previous studies do no provide conclusive evidence that intelligence is the causal influence behind the AFI-intelligence relationship. Logically, other alternatives are that AFI has a causal link to intelligence (which is unlikely, for the obvious theoretical reasons, including that a child's intelligence precedes AFI in time) or that other confounds cause these two outcomes to correlate, but not causally.  There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of such confounds that can logically contend to explain the link between child intelligence and AFI.

\subsection{Intelligence as a Confound}\\
An equally valid set of explanations exist in which intelligence is not the causal factor behind the AFI-intelligence relationship, but rather one of dozens of potentially explanatory processes (though obviously  a theoretically explanatory process). Instead, various confounds including family level selection effects, or third variables at the individual level could be causing the relationship. Indeed many such findings that link intelligence with various outcomes are quite possibly the product of misattributing between family confounds to individual-level causes. \cil{You had made an edit changing individual-level to individual-yahooyahoo level. I think that this is a typo}

The relationship between birth order and intelligence is a classic example of this misattribution \citep[See][]{damian2015associations,Rodgers2000,rodgers2014birth}. Between-family studies that rely on cross-sectional data have consistently found that first born children have higher IQs than later born children \citep{belmont1973birth,zajonc1976family}. Yet within family studies have often found zero relationship \citep{berbaum1980intellectual,retherford1991birth,Rodgers2000}. Moreover, when designs that can distinguish within- and between-family variance have been  conducted, the methodological source of the IQ-birth order effects have emerged from the between family variance \citep{black2011older,rodgers1984confluence,Rodgers2000,Wichman2006,Wichman2007}. Potential causes of this confound include maternal age at first birth, parental IQ, parental education, and SES\footnote{Selection effects based on SES should not to be confused with the confluence/resource dilution model \citep{Blake1981,zajonc1980}}\citep{page1979family,Rodgers2000}. See \citet{Anastasi1956} for an insightful overview, written prior to the IQ-birth order debate.\footnote{``Parenthetically, it may be added that studies on the relation of birth order to intellectual and other psychological characteristics have frequently yielded ambiguous and inconsistent results because of the failure to take family size into account.''\citep[pg 201]{Anastasi1956}}

Between family influences such as SES and maternal intelligence could drive the relationship. Socioeconomic status is associated with the onset of first intercourse \citep{Lammers2000} and correlated with intelligence \citep{murray1998income,Neisser1996,Strenze2007}. Parental intelligence and parental education are also linked with child intelligence \citep{Bouchard2004,devlin1997heritability,mercy1982familial}, and pose very viable alternative explanations in which parents are the one dissuading their children from engaging in early intercourse. For example, daughters whose mothers communicated frequently about the risk associated with sexual intercourse were less likely to have unprotected sex and engaged in sex less frequently \citep{hutchinson2003role}. Thus it could be that intelligent mothers, not intelligent children, are the ones recognizing the consequences of early intercourse and acting accordingly.in order to truly understand the causal nature of intelligence on Age at First Intercourse, we need to be able to untangle between and within family processes.
\subsection{Prior Within Family Analyses} The authors are aware of two studies which explicitly untangled between and within family influences on the AFI-intelligence relationship \citep{harden2011don,Meredith2013}.\footnote{Technically, three studies -- \citet{nedelec2012exploring} conducted an extensive exploratory analysis of MZ twin pairs from the Add Health Study. They used intelligence difference scores to predict various social outcomes. They generally found null results in their small samples (N ranged from 48 to 166 pairs). Their sample is an underpowered subset of the same sample that \citet{harden2011don} used.} 
\citet{harden2011don} used 536 same-sex twin pairs from the Add Health Study to ``test[] whether relations between intelligence, academic achievement and age at first sex were due to unmeasured genetic and environmental differences between families.'' Twins who differed in their intelligence or their academic achievement did not differ in their age at first intercourse. They concluded that ''the association between intelligence and age at first sex could be attributed entirely to unmeasured environmental differences between families.''

\section{Cause or Confound?}
There are numerous theories on the motivations behind adolescents initiation of first intercourse (See \citealp{Rodgers1996} or \citealp{Buhi2007} for a review), and even more specific antecedents \citep{Buhi2007,kirby2002antecedents,miller1997timing,santelli1992risk}. Many of these theories either emphasize biology/genetics, where typical adolescent development through puberty (and various hormone changes) drives the interest in sexual behavior \citep{miller1999dopamine,udry1979age}, or social/environmental processes, such as Social Learning \citep{diblasio1990adolescent,hogben1998using}, where social norms alter the likelihood of early sexual behavior; or Social Control theory \citep{hirschi2002causes}, where societal convention reduces the likelihood that individuals will act on their naturally deviant behavior. Under these environmentally centric theories the underlying biology is either ignored or actively resisted (in the case of Social Control theory, while under many of the genetic centric theories, the environmental components are ignored. 

Recently, there have been numerous articles advocating integrative models (See \citealp{harden2008rethinking} and \citealp{harden2014genetic}). The integrative Biopsychosocial Model acknowledges both genetic and environmental contributions to human behavior \citep{Engel1977,petersen1987nature,rodgers1999nature}. Indeed, biology, psychology, and society jointly influence adolescents' decisions to engage in sexual intercourse \citep{Meschke2000,zimmer2008ten}. Even though this paper focuses on a single predictor -- intelligence, we are doing so within the broader context.

\subsection{Intelligence as the Cause}
We've previously mentioned that the short-term risks of early AFI are overwhelming negative, whereas the rewards for delay are equally positive. These consequences extend into adulthood -- early AFI is associated with adult delinquency \citep{harden2008rethinking}, anti-social behavior, and substance abuse \citep{boislard2011individual}, while those who delayed had higher household incomes in adulthood \citep{Harden2012}. It is intuitively appealing to believe that intelligent individuals are more likely to observe this high risk, low reward trade off, and act upon such observations by delaying intercourse. Accordingly, intelligent individuals perceive the consequences of early AFI to have career--shattering outcomes \citep{halpern2000smart,harden2011don}.

Indeed, the literature is consistent with this theory. Those with higher educational goals delay their first intercourse \citep{boislard2011individual,schvaneveldt2001academic}, while those who had previously reported higher goals, but engaged in early sexual intercourse reduced their goals \citep{schvaneveldt2001academic}. Beyond academic goals, those with a greater affinity for risk and those who perceive benefits from teen-pregnancy are more likely to engage in risky sexual activities \citep{raffaelli2003sexual}. A greater understanding of the risks associated with sexual intercourse, such as HIV transmission, is also associated with delayed AFI \citep{mathews2009predictors}.

Smarter adolescents are more likely to report delayed intercourse \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}. Beyond intercourse, smarter individuals appear to postpone all sexual/romantic activity \citep{halpern2000smart}. Such blanket delays may be a proactive attempt to avoid first intercourse precursors. Thus, many researchers have concluded that ``[h]igher intelligence operates as a protective factor against early sexual activity during adolescence, and lower intelligence, to a point, is a risk factor.'' \citep{halpern2000smart}[pg., 213].

However, \citet{halpern2000smart} and many of the other studies we have referenced above\citep[e.g.,][]{mathews2009predictors,miller1997timing,Paul2000} have used between family designs, typically cross-sectional in nature. Such designs cannot distinguish between processes that act to create differences between families and processes that create differences among family members\citep{Lahey2010}. Thus the previous studies do no provide conclusive evidence that intelligence is the causal influence behind the AFI-intelligence relationship.

\subsection{Intelligence as a Confound}\\
A equally valid family of explanations exist in which intelligence is not the driver of the AFI-intelligence relationship, merely a theoretically attractive confound. Instead, various confounds including family level selection effects, or third variables at the individual level could be causing the relationship. Indeed many such findings that link intelligence with various outcomes are the product of misattributing between family confounds to individual level causes. 

The relationship between birth order and intelligence is a classic example of this misattribution (See \citealp{Rodgers2000}, \citealp{rodgers2014birth}, or \citealp{damian2015associations}). Between family studies have consistently found that first born children have higher IQs than later born children \citep{belmont1973birth,zajonc1976family}, and that first borns are higher achievers \citep{clark1982family,galton1875english}. Yet within family studies have just as consistently found zero relationship \citep{berbaum1980intellectual,retherford1991birth,Rodgers2000}. Moreover, when within and between analyses are simultaneously conducted, the methodological source of the IQ-birth order effect are clearly revealed -- between family differences in family size \citep{black2011older,Rodgers2000,Wichman2006,Wichman2007}. Potential causes of this confound include parental IQ and SES\footnote{Selection effects based on SES should not to be confused with the confluence/resource dilution model \citep{Blake1981,zajonc1980}}\citep{page1979family,Rodgers2000}. See \citet{Anastasi1956} for an insightful overview, written prior to the IQ-birth order debate.\footnote{``Parenthetically, it may be added that studies on the relation of birth order to intellectual and other psychological characteristics have frequently yielded ambiguous and inconsistent results because of the failure to take family size into account.''\citep[pg 201]{Anastasi1956}}

Between family influences such as SES and maternal intelligence could drive the relationship. Socioeconomic status is associated with the onset of first intercourse \citep{Lammers2000} and correlated with intelligence \citep{murray1998income,Neisser1996,Strenze2007}. Parental intelligence and parental education are also linked with child intelligence \citep{Bouchard2004,devlin1997heritability,mercy1982familial}, and pose very viable alternative explanations in which parents are the one dissuading their children from engaging in early intercourse. For example, daughters whose mothers communicated frequently about the risk associated with sexual intercourse were less likely to have unprotected sex and engaged in sex less frequently \citep{hutchinson2003role}. Thus it could be that intelligent mothers, not intelligent children, are the ones recognizing the consequences of early intercourse and acting accordingly.in order to truly understand the causal nature of intelligence on Age at First Intercourse, we need to be able to untangle between and within family processes.
\subsection{Prior Within Family Analyses} The authors are aware of two studies which explicitly untangled between and within family influences on the AFI-intelligence relationship \citep{harden2011don,Meredith2013}.\footnote{Technically, three studies -- \citet{nedelec2012exploring} conducted an extensive exploratory analysis of MZ twin pairs from the Add Health Study. They used intelligence difference scores to predict various social outcomes. They generally found null results in their small samples (N ranged from 48 to 166 pairs). Their sample is an underpowered subset of the same sample that \citet{harden2011don} used.} 
\citet{harden2011don} used 536 same-sex twin pairs from the Add Health Study to ``test[] whether relations between intelligence, academic achievement and age at first sex were due to unmeasured genetic and environmental differences between families.'' Twins who differed in their intelligence or their academic achievement did not differ in their age at first intercourse. They concluded that ''the association between intelligence and age at first sex could be attributed entirely to unmeasured environmental differences between families.''

Higher levels of intelligence are positively associated with delaying first intercourse \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}), as well as less-intimate sexual involvement \citep{halpern2000smart}. Specifically, it has been suggested that intelligent individuals delay intercourse to ``safeguard'' their futures \citep{kirby2002effective, manlove1998influence, raffaelli2003sexual}. They perceive the risks associated with early intercourse, (\eg, pregnancy, STIs) to have life- and career-shattering outcomes \citep{halpern2000smart,harden2011don}. Although the link between intelligence and AFI has face validity, and has been confidently asserted (or often implied) as a causal link, a fundamental confound exists in most past research that limits our ability to infer causality.

Virtually all of the AFI-intelligence literature has used between family designs. In all such analyses, genetic and environmental influences, such as education and maternal intelligence are confounded \citep{DOnofrio2013,harden2014genetic,Lahey2010,Rodgers2000}. By ignoring such confounds, the source of variance is ambiguous, and researchers that attribute the source to specific between- or within-family sources risk misattributions of causality \citep{Rowe1997,Rutter2007}. Indeed, both intelligence and AFI are \citep{harden2011don,harden2014genetic,plomin2004intelligence,rodgers1999nature,rodgers1994df}. Thus, we need to critically evaluate whether intelligence is a cause of AFI or merely a theoretically attractive confound. To resolve some of these methodological challenges, we use design innovations that emerge from the excellent cross-generational and longitudinal structure of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY;  we use both the original NLSY79 survey and the NLSY-Children survey, described below).

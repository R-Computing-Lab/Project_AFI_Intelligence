Higher levels of intelligence are positively associated with delaying first intercourse \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}. Specifically, it seems that intelligent individuals delay intercourse to ``safeguard'' their futures \citep{kirby2002effective, manlove1998influence, raffaelli2003sexual}. They perceive the risks associated with early intercourse, (e.g., pregnancy, STIs) to have career--shattering outcomes \citep{halpern2000smart,harden2011don}. Although this correlate holds promise -- much of the field has treated this finding as causal and non-spurious. Yet, there is a fundamental confound in the existing literature that makes it impossible to infer causality.

Practically, all of the AFI-intelligence literature has used between family analyses. In all such analyses, gene and environmental influences, such as education and maternal intelligence are hopelessly confounded \citep[See][]{harden2014genetic}. By ignoring such confounds, results are uninterpretable and risk misattributions of causality \citep{Rowe1997,Rutter2007}. Indeed, both intelligence and AFI are highly heritable and have sizable shared environmental variances \citep{harden2011don,harden2014genetic,plomin2004intelligence}. Thus, we need to critically evaluate whether intelligence is a cause of AFI or merely a theoretically attractive confound.

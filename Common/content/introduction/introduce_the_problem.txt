Anecdotal evidence from the popular media, such as MTV's reality television franchise, \textit{16 and Pregnant}\nocite{mtv}, suggests that teenage sexual involvement is on the rise. Academic research supports such evidence; age at first intercourse (AFI) is indeed declining and has for some time \citep{bozon2003,finer2007trends,Kann2014}. Early AFI is associated with downstream consequences, including lower education attainment \citep{Harden2012,Spriggs2008,Wellings2001}, failure to meet education and career goals \citep{halpern2000smart}, increased risk of teenage pregnancy \citep{Leitenberg2000,Wellings2001}, and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections \citep{kaestle2005young}. Moreover, beyond the obvious benefit of avoiding those negative outcomes, delaying AFI is associated with greater relationship satisfaction, perception of increased attractiveness, and higher household income \citep{Harden2012}. Because many of the negative consequences above are severe and long-reaching, it is important to identify the causal mechanisms associated with early AFI. One potential causal influence on AFI that has received attention is intelligence.

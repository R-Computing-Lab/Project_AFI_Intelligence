Anecdotal evidence from the popular media, such as MTV's reality television franchise, \textit{16 and Pregnant}\nocite{mtv}, suggests that teenage promiscuity is on the rise. Academic evidence confirms such anecdotes; age at first intercourse (AFI) is indeed declining and has so for some time \citep{bozon2003,finer2007trends}. Early AFI is associated with a plethora of negative downstream consequences, including lower education attainment \citep{Harden2012,Spriggs2008,Wellings2001}, failure to meet education and career goals \citep{halpern2000smart}, increased risk of teenage pregnancy \citep{Leitenberg2000,Wellings2001}, and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections \citep{kaestle2005young}. Moreover, beyond the obvious benefit of avoiding those negative outcomes, delaying AFI is associated with greater relationship satisfaction, perception of increased attractiveness, and higher household income \citep{Harden2012}. Because the aforementioned consequences are severe and long-reaching, psychology has begun to explore potential causal mechanisms of early AFI. Indeed, the field has found a consistent correlate in the literature -- intelligence.

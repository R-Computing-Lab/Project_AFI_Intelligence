\subsubsection{Generation 1 AFI}NLSY-79 subjects indicated their AFI a maximum of three times, in response to questions in 1983, 1984, and 1985. The 1984 and 1985 questions were included to assess those with non-response in 1983, but in fact many female respondents were surveyed multiple times.  Further, female were asked for additional related information (Year of First Intercourse, Month of First Intercourse) in 1984 and 1985. 

We used the repeated questions to estimate the test-retest reliability of self-reported AFI and AFI difference scores. In Table \ref{table_measurement_trt_g1afi}, the lower triangle reports the correlations of self-reported AFI across 1983-1985; the diagonal indicates the number of respondents reporting AFI for that year, and upper triangle indicate the number of respondents that reported AFI for both respect years. The test-retest correlations are high ( r $>$ .75) across all viable pairings, suggesting that our subjects are consistently reporting their AFIs.\medskip\\

\subsubsection{Generation 2 AFI}Over the life-time of the NLSY-Children survey, participants were asked approximately the same questions to assess AFI that their mothers were asked. However, Generation 2 respondents were only asked for AFI information once they had reached age 15 or later. The exact nature of the question varied by administration. Between 1988 and 2000, subjects were asked for age, year, and month of first intercourse. After 2000, subjects were only asked their age.

We calculated AFI using a multi-step process for three reasons: (1) to account for the diversity of AFI questions across survey administrations, (2) to incorporate multiple reports by the same participant, and (3) to account for the imprecision of AFI reporting(\eg, a subject who reports AFI at 16 could be any age between 16 years and 1 day old through 16 years and 364 days old).

For each survey, we transformed year of first intercourse into AFI. If subjects reported both age and year within the same survey and ages were different, we averaged the AFI scores. Across surveys, we identified the earliest AFI and the latest AFI for each subject. We designated these two AFIs as the Minimum AFI and the Maximum\footnote{We added 1 year to the Maximum AFI to address the imprecision of self-reported age. The expected value of AFI of any subject does not equal the reported AFI. For example, a subject who reports AFI at 16 could be anywhere from 16 years and 1 day old to 16 years and 364 days old.} AFI respectively, thus identifying the full range of possible AFIs for each participant. We used this AFI range to calculate the expected value of AFI. Using this method, the average Generation 2 AFI was 16.01 years (sd $= 2.30$; n $= 6288$).\footnote{Taking the average of all AFIs (without addressing expected value), results in 15.49 (sd = 2.30; n = 6288). Adding in expected value of .5 changes this value to 15.99.}
\cil{My motivation was to incorporate the maximum amount of information into our calculated AFI, so that I could use all of that information in survival analytic models. Using the more precise data here, is just a nice bonus.

In essence, what we did was find the midpoint of possible AFIs for each subject. The minimum AFI was the earliest possible reported AFI across all survey waves. And the maximum was the latest reported AFI plus 1}
\cil{Mason - I find this paragraph really confusing, both the motivation and the procedure - I helped you do this, and I still don't know what most of this means.  Did we create a SAS variable for age when we could?  And otherwise created the most precise variable we could with what we had? More discussion about this before we're ready for this paragraph to go public.}

After transforming all AFI scores, we recoded impossible AFIs as missing. A score was impossible if the reported AFI that exceeded participant's age at time of survey ($\overline{\mathrm{AFI}} = 15.99$, sd $= 2.30$, n $= 6235$). Next, we excluded all AFIs below age 12 (16.14, sd $= 2.10$, n $= 6087$). Finally we excluded subjects who reported AFI prior to menarche (16.16, sd $= 2.09$, n $= 6047$). We excluded those below age 12 because those responses likely are the result of misunderstanding or non-consensual sexual activity, while we excluded those with premenstrual AFI because of we were only interested in post-pubescent sexual activity. AFI varied by gender and race. Most notably, women reported AFIs that were 6 months later than men, and black men reported the lowest AFI (15 yrs) of any race-gender categories.

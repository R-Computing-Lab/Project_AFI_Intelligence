To summarize, the current study examines the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse, using siblings and their children from a multi-generational nationally representative sample, the NLSY. This examination extends the intelligence literature in several key ways. First, we tested whether the relationship between intelligence and AFI existed in either or both between- and within-family analyses. Second, we evaluated the alternative explanation that maternal intelligence influences child AFI, using the cross-generational structure of the NLSY. Third, we replicated our findings using two different age periods.

We made the following predictions, based primarily upon \citet{harden2011don}:\\ 
Between Families,\\
1.\hypothesis{btw_2_2} Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: We expect intelligence to be associated with age of first intercourse because there is a sizable body of literature reporting that result \citep{kirby2002effective, manlove1998influence, raffaelli2003sexual}.\\ 
2.\hypothesis{btw_1_2} Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: We also expect maternal intelligence to be associated with age of first intercourse because the heritability of intelligence is quite high \citep{Bouchard2004,devlin1997heritability}. If intelligence does causally influence AFI we would expect that the cross-generational association between AFI and intelligence would be considerably weaker, but existent. However, if the intelligence-AFI relationship is the product of between family confounds, then we would expect that the cross-generational association between AFI and intelligence would be stronger than the within generation association because maternal intelligence would be more closely linked with household SES and various parental causes. Comparably sized effects would also be consistent with a between family confound. Given that  \citet{harden2011don}  found no within family effect for intelligence, we expect that maternal intelligence will have a comparable or larger effect on between family AFI than child intelligence.\\
Within Families,\\
3.\hypothesis{wth_2_2} Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: No, we do not expect to find all within family differences in intelligence and AFI, given that \citet{harden2011don} did not report an effect.\\
4.\hypothesis{wth_1_2} Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: Unknown: it is possible that maternal intelligence will have an effect, as such a link would explain the between family effects as well as many of the alternative household-level influences.\\
5.\hypothesis{btw_v_wth} Is the relationship consistent across methods?: Doubtful, we do not expect the results to be consistent across methods because both \citet{harden2011don} and \citet{Meredith2013} found no within-family effect, while the traditional findings from between family studies find an effect \citep{kirby2002effective, manlove1998influence, raffaelli2003sexual}.

The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 dataset(NLSY79) is based on a nationally representative household probability sample, jointly sponsored by the US Bureau of Labor and US Department of Defense. On December 31, 1978, 12,686 adolescents were sampled within a household probability sample from 8,770 households on a battery of measures. The initial sample consisted of three subsamples: \begin{itemize}\item a cross--sectional household probability sample of 6,111 non-institutionalized adolescents residing in the United States on December $31^{st}$ of 1978; \item a separate over-sampled civilian subsample of  5,295 racial minorities and disadvantaged whites; \item a representative sample of 1,280 youth serving in the US Military on September $30^{th}$, 1978.\end{itemize} In the two civilian samples, subjects' birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1964, and were between the ages of 14 and 21 on December 31, 1978; whereas military subject's birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1961, and were between 17 and 21 years old. Participants were surveyed annually until 1994, and then surveyed biennially to the present. Two waves of planned attrition occurred. After the 1984 interview, all but 201 randomly selected members of the military sample were dropped. After the 1990 interview, all 1,643 disadvantaged whites from the oversample were dropped. More information about the sampling process and the data can be found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website: \url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}.

In 1986, the biological children of the female NLSY79 participants were surveyed, resulting in the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults (NLSY-Children) survey. These 11,512 participants are also surveyed on a biannual basis. Accordingly, participants in the NLSY79 will typically be referred to as the Generation 1 (Gen1) sample, whereas the NLSY-Children will be referred to as the Generation 2 (Gen2) sample.

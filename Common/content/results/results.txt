We examined the relationship between AFI and intelligence using two designs: between and within families. The results are organized into those two designs. The between family analyses report the relationships between the average AFI and various measures of ability. The within family analyses attempt to replicate the between family findings by testing whether differences in AFI can be explained by differences in various measures of ability. If there is a causal relationship between intelligence and AFI then differences in AFI will be significantly associated with differences in ability. If the relationship is the result of between family confounds, such as shared environmental influences, then differences in AFI will not be significantly associated with differences in ability, and accordingly, AFI cannot be caused by intelligence.

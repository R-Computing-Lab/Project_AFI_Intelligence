This article presents the relationship between AFI and intelligence using two difference designs: between- and within-family. The between-family design allowed us to replicate previous researchers who used a cross-sectional sample. The within-family design allowed us to evaluate intelligence differences within the family to address issues of causality. The results revealed a stark contrast between the two methods.
\subsection{Between vs. Within}
\subsubsection{Between} Notably, the between-family analyses showed a relationship between intelligence and AFI. Thus, we were able to replicate the findings of various researchers \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}, and confirm hypotheses \ref{hyp_btw_2_2} and \ref{hyp_btw_1_2}. However the relationship between AFI and intelligence was stronger between maternal intelligence and child AFI than between the child's own intelligence and child AFI, which suggests that family-level variables rather than individual-level intelligence is source of the relationship. If intelligence had causally influenced AFI we would seen a considerably weaker cross-generational association between AFI and intelligence. Instead we find that the within generation association is the weaker effect, suggesting that AFI is not causally influenced by intelligence.

 An alternative interpretation of this finding could be that maternal intelligence is driving the effect. Smarter mothers might be more effective at inducing their children to delay intercourse -- perhaps by effectively conveying the riskiness of sexual intercourse \citep{hutchinson2003role,mathews2009predictors}. Considering that intelligence is highly heritable \citep{Bouchard2004} and thus highly correlated across generations, this alternative explaination would still be consistent with the traditional between family findings, which do not control for maternal intelligence \citep{halpern2000smart,mott1983early,Paul2000,Woodward2001}. 
 

\subsubsection{Within} In the within-family analyses, the effect vanishes for both maternal intelligence and child intelligence. The smarter of the Generation 2 children was not more likely to delay intercourse. Moreover, in spite of our finding that the Generation 1 intelligence was a relatively strong predictor of Generation 2 AFI, we did not find that differences in Generation 1 intelligence are associated with differences in Generation 2 AFI. Thus, the alternative explaination for the between-family results we posed in the previous paragraph cannot be the case. For, if Generation 1 intelligence was driving the effect, we would have found a significant association, which we did not.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}
\citet{Rodgers2008AJS} looked at the relationship between IQ and education as they influenced age at first birth in Danish twin data.  Their conclusion:\begin{quote} [V]ariance in AFB emerges from [IQ and education] differences between families, not differences between sisters within the same family.\end{quote}
We have exactly the same result in the current study. Notably, the IQ differences between siblings are relatively small; is this important? Under a purely genetic model, \citet{Rodgers1987}, estimated the average absolute deviation in IQ among random pairs to be 17.1 IQ points, compared to 12.1 for full siblings. But cousins, who also are in our study, deviate on average by 16.1 IQ points, nearly as much as random pairs.

We believe that differences within the family simply are not important for defining AFI outcome differences. This finding matches the \citet{harden2011don} biometrical analysis of Add Health, where they found that only shared environmental influences mattered – those would manifest in between-family differences, but not in within-family differences.

Further, we're not convinced that in these between-family analyses, intelligence is the actual cause of AFI differences – if so, we think they would perhaps diffuse a bit, but would still show up in within-family analyses
Rather, we think maternal and child IQ are indirect measures of many other household features, any one of which may be more proximal as the causal explanation – income, parental education, family interaction. Or, the whole package of these features may stand in for a general environmental factor, a ``little e,'' which indexes the quality of home environment – a composite of parental income, intelligence, education, family interaction.

We adapted Kenny and colleagues \citeyearpar{kenny2001social,kenny2006dyadic} reciprocal standard dyad model to facilitate sibling comparisons. Sibling-based quasi-experimental models are particularly effective at incorporating genetic and environmental design elements \citep{Lahey2010,Rutter2007}.
\begin{equation}\label{equation_discord_main}
\mathrm{Y_{i\Delta}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mathrm{\bar{Y_{i}}} + \beta_2\mathrm{\bar{X_{i}}} + \beta_3\mathrm{X_{i\Delta}}}
\end{equation}\vspace{-10pt}
where,
\begin{equation}\label{equation_discord_defs}
Y_{i1} = \mathrm{max}(Y_{ij});\, Y_{i2} = \mathrm{min}(Y_{ij});\, Y_{i\Delta} = Y_{i1} - Y_{i2};\, X_{i\Delta} = X_{i1} - X_{i2}
\end{equation}\\

In this model, the relative difference in kin outcomes ($\mathrm{Y_{\Delta}}$) is predicted from the mean level of the outcome ($\mathrm{Y_{mean}}$), the mean level of the predictor ($\mathrm{X_{mean}}$), and the between-kin predictor difference ($\mathrm{X_{\Delta}}$). The mean levels support causal inference through at least partial control for genes and shared environment. Therefore, we simultaneously evaluate the individual difference ($\mathrm{X_{\Delta}}$) and the joint contribution of genes and shared environment ($\mathrm{Y_{mean}}\,$\footnotesize{\&}\normalsize $\,\mathrm{X_{mean}}$).

More broadly, this model allows us to explicitly untangle between and within family influences. If there is a true causal effect between the individual difference and the outcome (in our case -- intelligence and AFI respectively), then we would expect kin differences in intelligence to be significantly associated with kin differences in the outcome. If the effect is a spurious effect -- \ie the function of between family differences -- then we would expect to find no significant relationship between the differences in the outcome with the differences in the predictor.

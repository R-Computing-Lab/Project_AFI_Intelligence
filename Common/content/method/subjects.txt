%Appropriate identification of research participants is critical to the science and practice of psychology, particularly for generalizing the findings, making comparisons across replications, and using the evidence in research syntheses and secondary data analyses. If humans participated in the study, report the eligibility and exclusion criteria, including any restrictions based on demographic characteristics.

%Describe the sample adequately. Detail the sample's major demographic characteristics, such as age; sex; ethnic and/or racial group; level of education; socioeconomic, generational, or immigrant status; disability status; sexual orientation; gender identity; and language preference as well as important topic-specific characteristics (e.g., achievement level in studies of educational interventions). As a rule, describe the groups as specifically as possible, with particular emphasis on characteristics that may have bearing on the interpretation of results. Often, panicipant characteristics can be important for understanding the nature of the sample and the degree to which results can be generalized. To determine how far the data can be generalized, you may find it useful to identify subgroups: Even when a characteristic is not used in analysis of the data, reporting it may give readers a more complete understanding of the sample and the generalizability of results and may prove useful in meta-analytic studies that incorporate the article's results.

%When animals are used, report the genus, species, and strain number or other specific identification, such as the name and location of the supplier and the stock designation. Give the number of animals and the animals' sex, age, weight, and physiological condition.

The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) is a nationally representative household probability sample, jointly sponsored by the US Department of Labor and US Department of Defense. In 1980, 12,686 adolescents were surveyed from 8,770 households on a battery of measures. The initial survey consisted of three subsamples: \begin{itemize}\item a cross--sectional probability sample of 6,111 non-institutionalized adolescents residing in the United States on December $31^{st}$ of 1978, \item an over--sampled civilian subsample of  5,295 racial minorities and disadvantaged whites, and \item a representative sample of 1,280 youths serving in the US Military on September $30^{th}$, 1978.\end{itemize} In the civilian samples, subjects' birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1964, and were between the ages of 14 and 21 on $31^{st}$ of 1978, whereas military subject's birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1961, and were likewise between 17 and 21 years old. Participants were surveyed annually until 1994, and then surveyed biannually to the present day. Two waves of planned attrition occurred. After the 1984 interview, all but 201 randomly selected members of the military sample were dropped. After the 1990 interview, all 1,643 disadvantaged whites from the oversample were dropped. More information, such as the data and documentation can be found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website: \url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}.

In 1986, the biological children of the female NLSY79 participants were surveyed, resulting in the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults (NLSY79--CYA) survey. These 11,512 participants are also surveyed on a biannual basis. Accordingly, participants in the NLSY79 will be periodically referred to as the Generation 1 (Gen1) sample, whereas the NLSY79--CYA will be referred to as the Generation 2 (Gen2) sample.

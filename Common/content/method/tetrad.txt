Mother-Child-Aunt-Nibling (MCAN) tetrads were created using the NLSY Kinship Links \citep{nlsylinksbgpaper} and supporting R package \citep{nlsylinksr}. The oldest two female kin (Mother, Aunt) were selected from each household; additional female Generation 1 kin were excluded. Three tetrad designs were employed, in which the genders of Generation 2 were the defining feature: \begin{itemize}\item Mother-Daughter-Aunt-Niece (MDAN) included the oldest female child from each of the sisters, \item Mother-Son-Aunt-Nephew (MSAN) included the oldest male child from each of the sisters, and \item Mother-Child-Aunt-Nibling (MCAN) included the first born child from each of the sisters.\end{itemize} All outcomes were standardized by gender prior to tetrad creation. Table \vref{table_afi_race_gender} reports descriptive statistics for all relevative variables used throughout this paper by whether the respondent has a sibling in the sample.

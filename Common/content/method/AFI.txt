\subsubsection{Generation 1}NLSY-79 subjects were surveyed about their AFI over a maximum of three time-points (1983, 1984, 1985). In theory, subjects were only to be asked in later waves, if subjects had not reported an AFI in the 1983 wave. However, in practice, many subjects were surveyed twice. Female participants were asked additional information (Year of First Intercourse, Month of First Intercourse) in waves 1984 and 1985. Because subjects were surveyed repeatedly, we used this opportunity to estimate the reliability of self-reported AFI as well as the reliability of the AFI difference scores. In Table \vref{table_measurement_trt_g1afi}, the lower triangle reports the correlations of self-reported AFI across 1983-1985; the diagonal indicates the number of respondents reporting AFI for that year, and upper triangle indicate the number of respondents that reported AFI for both respect years. Stars indicate significant at the .01 level. The test-retest correlations are high ( r $>$ .75) across all viable pairings, suggesting that our subjects are consistently reporting their AFIs. 

\subsubsection{Gen2}Over the life-time of the NLSY-CYA survey, participants were surveyed about their AFI. The exact phrasing of the question varied by administration. Between 1988 and 2000, subjects were asked for age, year, and month of first intercourse. After 2000, subjects were only asked their age. The reason for this change is unknown. However, the first author suspects that the change had to do with the fact that the modal response for month was consistently: ``Don't Know''. Indeed, only 1147 subjects reported a viable month of first intercourse.

Regardless, we calculated AFI as follows, using SAS University Edition \cite{sas}. First, we transformed year of first intercourse into age. If subjects reported both age and year within the same survey, we averaged the age scores. Across all survey years, we identified the minimum AFI and maximum AFI for each subject. Then we took the average of those two scores. Given that the expected AFI of a subject $\neq$ the reported AFI, we added 1 to the Maximum AFI. Therefore, if the subject only reported one instance of AFI, their AFI would now reflect their expected AFI. For example, a subject who reports AFI at 16 could be 16 years and 1 day old OR 16 years and 364 days old. Thus the expected value for 16 is in fact 16.5. We calculated AFI in this manner because we wished to include the maximum amount of information without ignoring the expected value problem with self-reported age. Using this method, the average Gen2 AFI was 16.01 years (sd $= 2.30$; n $= 6288$).\footnote{Taking the average of all AFIs (without addressing expected value), results in 15.49 (sd = 2.30; n = 6288). Adding in expected value of .5 changes this value to 15.99.}

After transforming all AFI scores, we recoded all impossible AFIs as missing. We considered a score to be impossible if the reported AFI that exceeded participant's age at time of survey ($\overline{\mathrm{AFI}} = 15.99$, sd $= 2.30$, n $= 6235$). Next, we excluded all AFIs below age 12 (16.14, sd $= 2.10$, n $= 6087$). Finally we excluded subjects who reported AFI prior to menstruation (16.16, sd $= 2.09$, n $= 6047$). We excluded those below age 12 because those responses likely are the result of misunderstanding or non-consensual sexual activity, while we excluded those with premenstrual AFI because of we were only interested in post-pubescent sexual activity. AFI varied by gender and race. Most notably, women reported AFIs that were 6 months later than men, and black men reported the lowest AFI (15 yrs).

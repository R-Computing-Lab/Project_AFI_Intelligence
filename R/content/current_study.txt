To summarize, the current study examines the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse, using siblings and their children from a multigenerational nationally representative sample. This examination extends the intelligence literature in several key ways. We \begin{enumerate}\item tested whether the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse was consistent using between and within family analyses; \item evaluated the alternative explanation that maternal intelligence influences child AFI; and \item replicated this findings using assessments of intelligence from other ages.\end{enumerate}

We made the following predictions, based primary upon \citet{Harden2012} and \citet{Harden2011}:\\ 
Between Families,\\
1.\hypothesis{btw_2_2} Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: We expect intelligence to be associated with age of first intercourse because there is a sizable body of literature reporting that result \citep{kirby2002effective, manlove1998influence, raffaelli2003sexual}.\\ 
2.\hypothesis{btw_1_2} Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?: We also expect maternal intelligence to be associated with age of first intercourse because the heritability of intelligence is quite high \citep{Bouchard2004,devlin1997heritability}. If intelligence does causally influence AFI we would expect that the cross-generational association between AFI and intelligence would be considerably weaker, but existant. However, if the intelligence-AFI relaitonship is the product of between family confounds, then we would expect that the cross-generational associoation between AFI and intelligence would be stronger than the within generation association because maternal intelligence would be more closely linked with household SES and various parental causes. Comparably sized effects would also be consistent with a between family confound. Given that \citet{Harden2012} and \citet{Harden2011} found no within family effect for intelligence, we expect that maternal intelligence will have a comparable or larger effect on between family AFI than child intelligence. \end{enumerate}
Within Families,
\begin{enumerate}[resume]\item \hypothesis{wth_2_2}Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?:\end{enumerate} No, we do not expect to find all within family differences in intelligence and AFI, given that neither \citet{Harden2012}, not \citet{Harden2011} reported an effect.
\begin{enumerate}[resume] \item \hypothesis{wth_1_2}Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?:\end{enumerate} Unknown: it is possible that maternal intelligence will have an effect, as such a link would explain the between family effects as well as many of the alternative household-level influences.
\begin{enumerate}[resume] \hypothesis{btw_v_wth} Is the relationship consistent across methods?:\end{enumerate} Doubtful BECAUSE REASONS.

We attempted to replicate the between family analyse reported in the previous subsection, using within family analyses. Using the discordant sibling model, we predicted the differences in Gen2 AFI as a function of differences in intelligence, controlling for means of the outcomes and predictors. We ran three series of models, where we examined the individual and then joint influence of Gen1 intelligence and Gen2 intelligence. Moreover, within each series we included three Gen2 linking variants, just as we did in the between family analyses: Mixed model reports the differences of the first borns of each sister, the Daughters model reports the differences of the first born girls,, and the Sons model reports the differences of the first born sons.

\subsubsection{Dif Gen1 Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Dif Gen2 AFI} 
Gen1 sister differences in standardized AFQT scores were used to predict Gen2 differences of gender standardized AFI, controlling for Gen1 sister averages of standardized AFQT scores and Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI. Table \vref{table_Dif_Mom_Intelligence_Dif_Child_AFI_9} displays the results by Gen2 linking. The Mixed model reports the averages and differences of the first borns of each sister (n $= 336$), the Daughters model reports the averages and differences of the first born girls (n $= 258$), and the Sons model reports the averages and differences of the first born sons (n $= 278$). All three models reveal similar results. Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI were significant predictors of Gen2 differences in gender standardized AFI (p $< .01$), across all three linking methods. A one unit increase in the average gender standardized AFI predicted $\approx 0.34$ increase in average Gen2 AFI difference, controlling for all over variables in the model. 

In the Sons model, the Gen1 sister average of standardized AFQT scores was a significant predictor of differences in Gen2 AFI (p $< .01$). A one unit increase in the average standardized intelligence of the children's mothers predicted $\approx .0083$ decrease in the AFI difference between siblings. All other variables were not significant, including all kin difference variables. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .066$, Daughters $= .072$, Sons $= .106$).


\subsubsection{Dif Gen2 Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Dif Gen2 AFI}
Gen2 cousin differences in standardized ability scores were used to predict Gen2 differences of gender standardized AFI, controlling for Gen2 cousin averages of standardized ability scores and gender standardized AFI. Table \vref{table_Dif_Kid_Intelligence_Dif_Child_AFI_9} displays the results by Gen2 linking. The Mixed model reports the averages and differences of the first borns of each sister (n $= 291$), the Daughters model reports the averages and differences of the first born girls (n $= 223$), and the Sons model reports the averages and differences of the first born sons (n $= 238$). All three models reveal similar results. Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI were significant predictors of Gen2 differences in gender standardized AFI (p $< .01$), across all three linking methods. A one unit increase in the average gender standardized AFI predicted $\approx 0.38$ increase in average Gen2 AFI difference, controlling for all over variables in the model. 

In the Sons model, the Gen2 cousin average of standardized ability scores was a significant predictor of differences in Gen2 AFI (p $< .05$). A one unit increase in the average standardized intelligence of the children predicted $\approx .107$ decrease in the AFI difference between siblings. All other variables were not significant, including all kin difference variables. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .103$, Daughters $= .121$, Sons $= .132$).

\subsubsection{Dif Joint Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Dif Gen2 AFI}
Gen1 sister differences in standardized AFQT scores and Gen2 cousin differences in standardized ability scores were used to predict Gen2 differences of gender standardized AFI, controlling for Gen1 sister averages of standardized AFQT scores, Gen2 cousin averages of standardized ability scores, and Gen2 cousin averages of gender standardized AFI. Table \vref{table_Dif_Joint_Intelligence_Dif_Child_AFI_9} displays the results by Gen2 linking. The Mixed model reports the averages and differences of the first borns of each sister (n $= 285$), the Daughters model reports the averages and differences of the first born girls (n $= 217$), and the Sons model reports the averages and differences of the first born sons (n $= 235$). All three models reveal similar results. Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI were significant predictors of Gen2 differences in gender standardized AFI (p $< .01$), across all three linking methods. A one unit increase in the average gender standardized AFI predicted $\approx 0.38$ increase in average Gen2 AFI difference, controlling for all over variables in the model. 

All other variables were not significant, including all kin difference variables. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .090$, Daughters $= .105$, Sons $= .131$).

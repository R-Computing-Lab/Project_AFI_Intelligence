\section{Measures}

\subsection{Generation 1}The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB; Form 8A; \citealp{Palmer1988}) was administered to Gen1 participants during the summer and fall of 1980 \citep{DoD1982}, and was used to establish national norms for the Department of Defense \citep{waters1987personnel}. The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) is derived from the ASVAB, and used as a measure of general trainability \citep{maier1986asvab}. It is a composite of four subscales: Arithmetic Reasoning (AR; 30 items), Math Knowledge (MK; 25 items), Paragraph Comprehension (PC; 15 items), and Word Knowledge (WK; 35 items). Arithmetic Reasoning targets the ability to solve word problems. Math Knowledge also tests quantitative ability, by assessing knowledge of high school level mathematics, with special emphasis on algebra, fractions, and geometry. The remaining subscales focus on verbal ability, and are sometimes referred to as the Verbal Composite (VE). Specifically, Word Knowledge tests the subjects' knowledge of the meaning of words within a given context, whereas Paragraph Comprehension targets a subject's ability to understand the meanings of paragraphs. Other administrations of the pencil and paper ASVAB reveal that all the AFQT subscales have high internal consistency ( $\alpha_{AR} = .91$; $\alpha_{WK} = .92$; $\alpha_{PC} = .81$; $\alpha_{MK} = .87$; \citealp{kass1982}). Reported reliability of the AFQT (8A) ranges from .87 to .93 \citep{Palmer1988}.

Methods of calculating the AFQT have varied throughout the ASVAB's administrative lifetime \citep{mayberry1992computing}. For pencil and paper administrations, standard scores were created for each of the subscale scores ($\bar{x}=50$, sd = 10), and then combined into a standard score. Then, the AFQT standard score is derived from the following formula:\begin{align}\text{AFQT} = \text{AR} + \text{MK} + 2\text{VE}, \\\text{where VE} = \text{PC} + \text{WK.}\end{align}

This score is then converted into a percentile, which determines an applicant's basic qualification for enlistment. All applicants must earn a score at or above the $10^{\text{th}}$percentile\citep{asvabtech4}. Each branch has its own minimum score, ranging from 31 to 36 \citep{army2013,UnitedStatesCoastGuard2004}, and each branch uses different linear combinations of these subtests to determine an applicant's eligibility for specialty positions. Additionally, multiple researchers have used the AFQT standard score as a proxy for general intelligence (\textit{g}) \citep{herrnstein1994bell,Der2009}. Indeed, the military has found that the AFQT correlated 0.8 with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS; \citealp{mcgrevy1974relationships}). Moreover, the AFQT consistently predicts outcomes traditionally associated with intelligence\citep{Welsh1990}, including grades \citep{wilbourn1984,mathews1977analysis}.

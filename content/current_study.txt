We wanted to know whether the Harden \& Mendle (2011) results would hold using a different design and data set. We examined the relationship between AFI and Intelligence using siblings and their children from a multigenerational nationally representative sample. Specifically, we addressed the following questions:\smallskip
\begin{itemize}\item Between Families,
\begin{itemize}\item Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen1 AFI?
\item Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?
\item Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?\end{itemize}
\item Within Families,
\begin{itemize}\item Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen1 AFI?
\item Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?
\item Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?\end{itemize}
\item Is the relationship consistent across methods?\end{itemize}

To summarize, the current study examines the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse, using siblings and their children from a multigenerational nationally representative sample. This examination extends the intelligence literature in several key ways. We \begin{enumerate}\item tested whether the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse was consistent using between and within family analyses; \item evaluated the alternative explanation that maternal intelligence influences child AFI; and \item whether these effects would replicate using earlier measures of intelligence.\end{enumerate}

We made the following predictions, based upon recent meta-analyses XX and findings from Harden and Mendle:  Between Families,
\begin{enumerate}\item \hypothesis{btw_1_1}Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen1 AFI?
\item \hypothesis{btw_1_2} Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?
\item \hypothesis{btw_2_2} Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?\end{enumerate}
Within Families,
\begin{enumerate}[resume]\item \hypothesis{wth_1_1}Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen1 AFI?
\item \hypothesis{wth_1_2}Does Gen1 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?
\item \hypothesis{wth_2_2}Does Gen2 intelligence predict Gen2 AFI?
\item \hypothesis{btw_v_wth} Is the relationship consistent across methods?\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item We wanted to know whether the Harden \& Mendle (2011) results would hold using a different design and data set.\smallskip
\item We examined the relationship between AFI and Intelligence using siblings and their children from a multigenerational nationally representative sample.\smallskip
\item Specifically, we addressed the following questions:\smallskip
\begin{itemize}\item Does intelligence (mother or child) predict child AFI, after controlling for gene and environmental confounds?\smallskip
\item Is this relationship consistent between-- and within--families?
\end{itemize}\end{itemize}


To summarize, the current study examines the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse, using siblings and their children from a multigenerational nationally representative sample. This examination extends the intelligence literature in several key ways. We \begin{enumerate}\item tested whether the relationship between intelligence and age at first intercourse was consistent using between and within family analyses; \item evaluated the alternative explanation that maternal intelligence influences child AFI; and \item whether these effects would replicate using earlier measures of intelligence.\end{enumerate}

We made the following predictions, based upon recent meta-analyses XX and findings from Harden and Mendle:  \begin{enumerate}\item \hypothesis{timing}

\item \hypothesis{similarity}

\item \hypothesis{stress} \end{enumerate}

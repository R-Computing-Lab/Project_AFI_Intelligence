First, we examined the between family results. We tested whether the family average of Gen2 AFI could be predicted by the family averages of Gen1 ability and of Gen2 ability. We evaluated the influences both independently and simultaneously. All ability scores have been standardized by generation ($\overline{g} = 0$, sd $= 1$), prior to averaging by household. AFI scores have been standardized by gender ($\overline{\mathrm{AFI}} = 0$, sd $= 1$), prior to averaging by household.

\subsubsection{Mean Gen1 Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Mean Gen2 AFI} Gen1 sister averages of standardized AFQT scores were used to predict Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI. Table \vref{table_Mean_Mom_Intelligence_Mean_Child_AFI_9} displays the results by Gen2 linking. The Mixed model reports the averages of the first borns of each sister (n $= 342$), the Daughters model reports the averages of the first born girls (n $= 264$), and the Sons model reports the averages of the first born sons (n $= 282$). All three models reveal similar results. A one unit increase in the average standardized intelligence of the childrens' mothers predicted $\approx .013$ increase in average Gen2 AFI. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .087$, Daughters $= .097$, Sons $= .103$).

\subsubsection{Mean Gen2 Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Mean Gen2 AFI} Gen2 cousin averages of standardized ability scores were used to predict Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI. Table \vref{table_Mean_Child_Intelligence_Mean_Child_AFI_9} displays the results by Gen2 linking. The Mixed model reports the averages of the first borns of each sister (n $= 344$), the Daughters model reports the averages of the first born girls (n $= 267$), and the Sons model reports the averages of the first born sons (n $= 283$). All three models reveal similar results. A one unit increase in the average standardized intelligence of the children predicted $\approx .075$ increase in average Gen2 AFI. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .014$, Daughters $= .016$, Sons $= .009$).

\subsubsection{Mean Joint Intelligence $\rightarrow$ Mean Gen2 AFI} Results from the Gen1 sister averages of standardized AFQT scores and Gen2 cousin averages of standardized ability scores predictions of Gen2 averages of gender standardized AFI are displayed in Table \vref{table_Mean_Joint_Intelligence_Mean_Child_AFI_9}. Again, three models based on Gen2 linking are displayed: Mixed (n $= 337$), Daughters(n $= 260$), and the Sons(n $= 278$). All three models reveal similar results. Gen1 intelligence was significantly associated with Gen2 AFI (p $< .01$), while Gen2 intelligence was not significantly associated with Gen2 AFI. A one unit increase in the average standardized intelligence of the childrens' mothers predicted $\approx .014$ increase in average Gen2 AFI. The adjusted R$^{2}$ varied slightly by Gen2 linking (Mixed $= .086$, Daughters $= .097$, Sons $= .100$), but each were practically identical to the Mean Gen1 Intelligence models.

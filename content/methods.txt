\subsection{Design}
We adapted Kenny and colleagues \citeyearpar{kenny2001social,kenny2006dyadic} reciprocal standard dyad model.\\
\begin{center}\vspace{-17pt}
\[\mathrm{Y_{i\Delta}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mathrm{\bar{Y_{i}}} + \beta_2\mathrm{\bar{X_{i}}} + \beta_3\mathrm{X_{i\Delta}}}\]
\end{center}\vspace{1pt}
where
\begin{center}\vspace{-40pt}
\[ Y_{i1} = \mathrm{max}(Y_{ij});\, Y_{i2} = \mathrm{min}(Y_{ij});\, Y_{i\Delta} = Y_{i1} - Y_{i2};\, X_{i\Delta} = X_{i1} - X_{i2}\]
\vspace{-25pt}\end{center}

In this model, the relative difference in outcomes ($\mathrm{Y_{\Delta}}$) is predicted from the mean level of the outcome ($\mathrm{Y_{mean}}$), the mean level of the predictor ($\mathrm{X_{mean}}$), and the between-sibling predictor difference ($\mathrm{X_{\Delta}}$). The mean levels support causal inference through at least partial control for genes and shared environment. Therefore, we simultaneously evaluate the individual difference ($\mathrm{X_{\Delta}}$) and the joint contribution of genes and shared environment ($\mathrm{Y_{mean}}\,$\footnotesize{\&}\normalsize $\,\mathrm{X_{mean}}$). Preliminary applications have given estimates consistent with the literature \citep{garrison2015spsp,rodgers2014bga}.

\subsection{Sample}
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) is a nationally representative household probability sample, jointly sponsored by the US Department of Labor and US Department of Defense. In 1980, 12,686 adolescents were surveyed from 8,770 households on a battery of measures. The initial survey consisted of three subsamples: \begin{itemize}\item a cross--sectional probability sample of 6,111 non-institutionalized adolescents residing in the United States on December $31^{st}$ of 1978, \item an over--sampled civilian subsample of  5,295 racial minorities and disadvantaged whites, and \item a representative sample of 1,280 youths serving in the US Military on September $30^{th}$, 1978.\end{itemize} In the civilian samples, subjects' birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1964, and were between the ages of 14 and 21 on $31^{st}$ of 1978, whereas military subject's birthdates ranged from January 1, 1957 to December 31, 1961, and were likewise between 17 and 21 years old. Participants were surveyed annually until 1994, and then surveyed biannually to the present day. Two waves of planned attrition occurred. After the 1984 interview, all but 201 randomly selected members of the military sample were dropped. After the 1990 interview, all 1,643 disadvantaged whites from the oversample were dropped. More information, such as the data and documentation can be found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website: \url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}.

In 1986, the biological children of the female NLSY79 participants were surveyed, resulting in the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults (NLSY79--CYA) survey. These 11,512 participants are also surveyed on a biannual basis. Accordingly, participants in the NLSY79 will be periodically referred to as the Generation 1 (Gen1) sample, whereas the NLSY79--CYA will be referred to as the Generation 2 (Gen2) sample.

\subsection{Tetrads} Mother-Child-Aunt-Nibling (MCAN) tetrads were created using the NLSY Kinship Links \citep{nlsylinksbgpaper} and supporting R package \citep{nlsylinksr}. The oldest two female kin (Mother, Aunt) were selected from each household; additional female Gen1 kin were excluded. Three tetrad designs were employed, in which the genders of Gen2 were the defining feature: \begin{itemize}\item Mother-Daughter-Aunt-Niece (MDAN) included the oldest female child from each of the sisters, \item Mother-Son-Aunt-Nephew (MSAN) included the oldest male child from each of the sisters, and \item Mother-Child-Aunt-Nibling (MCAN) included the first born child from each of the sisters.\end{itemize} All outcomes were standardized by gender prior to tetrad creation. Table \vref{table_afi_race_gender} reports descriptive statistics for all variables used throughout this paper by whether the respondent has a sibling in the sample.

\subsection{Age at First Intercourse}

Over the life-time of the NLSY-CYA survey, participants were surveyed about their AFI. The exact phrasing of the question varied by administration. Between 1988 and 2000, subjects were asked for age, year, and month of first intercourse. After 2000, subjects were only asked their age. The reason for this change is unknown. However, the first author suspects that the change had to do with the fact that the modal response for month was consistently: ``Don't Know''. Indeed, only 1147 subjects reported a viable month of first intercourse. Regardless, we calculated AFI as follows, using SAS (citation). First, we transformed year of first intercourse into age. If subjects reported both age and year within the same survey, we averaged the age scores. Across all survey years, we identified the minimum AFI and maximum AFI for each subject. Then we took the average of those two scores. Given that the expected AFI of a subject $\neq$ the reported AFI, we added 1 to the Maximum AFI. Therefore, if the subject only reported one instance of AFI, their AFI would now reflect their expected AFI. For example, a subject who reports AFI at 16 could be 16 years and 1 day old OR 16 years and 364 days old. Thus the expected value for 16 is in fact 16.5. We calculated AFI in this manner because we wished to include the maximum amount of information without ignoring the expected value problem with self-reported age. Using this method, the average AFI was 16.01 years (sd $= 2.30$; n $= 6288$).\todo[color=green!40]{Taking the average of all AFIs (without addressing expected value), results in 15.49 (sd equal 2.30; n equal 6288). Adding in expected value of .5 changes this value to 15.99. Pretty much indistinguishable.)}

After transforming all AFI scores, we recoded all impossible AFIs as missing. We considered a score to be impossible if the reported AFI that exceeded participant's age at time of survey ($\overline{\mathrm{AFI}} = 15.99$, sd $= 2.30$, n $= 6235$). Next, we excluded all AFIs below age 12 (16.14, sd $= 2.10$, n $= 6087$). Finally we excluded subjects who reported AFI prior to menstruation (16.16, sd $= 2.09$, n $= 6047$). We excluded those below age 12 because those responses likely are the result of misunderstanding or non-consensual sexual activity, while we excluded those with premenstrual AFI because of we were only interested in post-pubescent sexual activity. AFI varied by gender and race. Most notably, women reported AFIs that were 6 months later than men, and black men reported the lowest AFI (15 yrs). See Table \vref{table_afi_race_gender} for a complete breakdown.
